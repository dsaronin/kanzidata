karko {ma}  -- pauper, bankrupt	__ AL, Adam: he defines it as "not having money". Cut. karko, Guj. kadko (pauper). Commonly called muflisi < Ar. muflis.
karo  -- anger, (rare) (with aspirated /kh/)	__ LK nml gives karo as "sudden anger, wanifanyia karo mimi, thou art angry with me." AL, KA. In modern standard Swahili it would be Wanitolea ukali./Unanikaripia. CR nml, defines it as "sudden fit of anger" and confuses it with kano (refusal) which is from the verb -kana (to refuse). In several Bantu languages of the Sabaki group, -kari/-kali (angry, fierce, sharp, intense etc.) appears as an adjective, and -karipia (to be angry with) as a verb in the applicative; but not karo as a noun, nor does the simple verb form *kara exist in Swahili with any of these senses; but the inceptive derived verb -kalimpa occurs in some languages such as in Nyiha. Traces of the Proto-Bantu root *kädl can be seen in many languages all over the Bantu speaking areas. Coincidentally, in Cut./Guj. kär is a noun and kärö is an adjective in the masculine singular. Probably Cut./Sindhi/Guj. kär (anger); cf. Sindikali. This word is homophonous with karo (gutter, sewage, with aspirated /kh/).
karori, korori, kururi {ma}  -- a hundred lakhi, ten million	__ AL. Cut./Guj./Hindi karör (ten million); cf. kar, kari. The form korori is through vowel harmony or regressive assimilation, whereas kururi is the arabized form.
karo  -- tax  (rare)	__ AL. Cut./Guj./Hindi kar (tax). This word is confused with the original Swahili word karo (sitting < kukaa < *kukara/kukala to sit) which according to an old tradition is a fee or present a pupil is expected to give to his teacher (for sitting in front of him, i.e. attending classes); FJ, CR & KA define it thus.

koroboi  -- young boy/girl freed from slavery and staying at a Christian mission station  (rare)	__ FJ gives the reported Eng. source "call a boy" with two other non-Swahili connotations also: kind of rifle (having Eng. source), and a small lamp without chimney. This last meaning is commonly found among many non-Swahili East Africans and is often synonymously used with karabai the pressure lamp. CS gives koroboy < Eng.

During the anti-slavery and abolition campaigns, captives and slaves freed by the British were called mateka both by freemen and the freed persons themselves since they were considered to be captives of the British.
